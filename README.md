## About

_By design_, you cannot use **OAuth2** without a server, since you need to store a _secret key_ from the provider.  
In a world full of PWA and static websites, it´s a _bummer_.

**oto** is a small middleware, a lambda serverless function, which only role is to serve as the server in a OAuth2 transaction.

## Installation

Firstly, run the classic `npm install` to install dependencies.
